discounts on total amount in invoices are given according to the following rules:
"clients are divided in two categories(1 and 2)
category 1 clients receive a discount of 10% on the first portion of $1000 of the amount and 15% on the portion above $1000, while category 2 clients receive only 10% on the portion above 1000$."

pseudocode and flowcart:

'..start
input amount
input category
if category ="1" then
    if amount>1000 then
        discount= amount*0.15
    else
        discount=amount*0.1
    endif
else
    if amount>1000 then
        discount= amount*0.1
    else
        discount=0
    endif
endif
output discount
